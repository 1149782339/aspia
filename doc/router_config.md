To configure the router
=======================
1. Place the configuration file (you can use the config template from 'default_config.json' file) in the same directory as the router executable file.
2. The configuration file must be named 'aspia_router.json).
3. Use a key generator to generate a private key (aspia_keygen).
4. Save the public key. You will need it to configure hosts and relays.
5. Add the private key to the router's configuration file.
6. Place the database file (you can use the database template from file 'default_database.db3'). in the same directory as the router executable file.
7. Utility 'aspia_router_manager' is used to manage the router. Default username and password: admin
